# About Me
I’m Junlong Tong, a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Shanghai Jiao Tong University and Eastern Institute of Technology, Ningbo, expected to graduate in June 2027. My research interests include Efficient LLMs, Multimodal LLMs, and Time Series Modeling. Currently, my research focuses on streaming multimodal large language models, including the architecture of streaming LLMs and their applications in multimodal scenarios. My long-term vision is to enable large language models to think and process real-world data in a streaming manner, similar to human cognition.
